To Lady Tanu of House Agrawal,

Happy, happy New Year!

As always, December flew by in the blink of an eye, didn’t it? But what a crazy month it was, bro!

From accepting Meesho to Rajasthan adventures! <3

This year, I made you take resolutions too, so here’s a little snippet of them. Don’t forget—I’ll hold you accountable every month! xD

And that reminds me... Naruuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

Bro, I had totally given up hope on this one, but then—you pulled off a reservation! Like, how crazy was that? And OMG, the ramen was so good. For those ten minutes when they served it, no one was talking—just slurping! Thank you so much, cutie. 

2024 was a year of many ups and a few downs. A lot of learning, a lot of growing, and understanding each other better. I’m so glad I had you by my side through it all. You’ve been my best cheerleader and wisest counsel. :)

And with that, here’s a list of the best meals we’ve shared this year (because food is love, lol):

Maverick & Farmer
Litti Chokha
Bukhara
Amudham
Chaat we made at home
Bunty Mahajan desserts
Shades of Coffee
Just Loaf
Naru
Cheers to many more meals and adventures  together in 2025! 

With Love,
Mahnot
