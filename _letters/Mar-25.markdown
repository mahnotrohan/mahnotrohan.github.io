Hey Bubs,How have you been?This past month has been a busy one for us, and I know I’ve been whining about not spending enough time together. What I really mean is - I miss just us, doing nothing. We’re around people more than before, and I hadn’t really thought about how much of a change that is. But its nice!I can’t wait to hear all about Phantom of the Opera and Lollapalooza! This Mumbai trip felt smoother than the ones before - third time’s the charm, huh? xDSomething’s been on my mind this past week. Someone at Skanda said, people just do what they want anyway, and they meant it negatively. A part of me gets it, but I also think - it’s not that people don’t value you, they just have their own way of seeing things. We've had similar conflicts, and I guess I’m trying to remind myself to be kinder.I’ve also been more open about us - with you and with others. Partly because I'm not hesitant to hide anything, and I guess also because we need other people too, right?Miss you.Adoringly,
Mahnot
