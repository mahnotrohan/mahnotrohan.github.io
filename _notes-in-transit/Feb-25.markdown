Hey Bubs,

Writing this one a little later than usual, as I've been sitting with my thoughts, trying to find the right words. Several drafts later, here I am, wanting to be completely raw with you.

Let me start with something that's been echoing in my mind -

"Love isn’t something we invented. It’s observable, powerful. It has to mean something. Love is the one thing that we’re capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that, even if we can’t yet understand it."

It takes me back to when I was hesitant to say "I love you”. I used to think I understood love. But lately, I realize it’s not something to be understood; it’s something to be felt. It’s not a single gesture, a person, or even an intention. It’s everything and something. A mix of moments, emotions, and choices. And maybe love isn’t about defining it, but simply experiencing it.

I’ve been thinking about you a lot.

Last week, we talked about taking a stand. And while I was encouraging you to stand up for yourself at work, I kept thinking - Tanu already knows how to do that. That’s one of the (many) things I have grown to admire about you. You know when to hold your ground, when to push forward, and when to let things be. I admire that more now.

Life is shifting around us and I kept telling myself, My entire life is about to change. But you reworded it: It’s a fresh start. And that shift in perspective has stayed with me. A friend also said that the more you frame something as “life-changing,” the more pressure you put on it. So maybe this is just a new beginning. For both of us. Yes, our lives - because I’m a part of yours, just as you are of mine.

Hope you’re settling in okay. I’ll be bringing over a few things soon - bit by bit, we’ll make the new space ours.

Adoringly,
Mahnot
