### Rohan Mahnot
I’m a Product Manager at Meesho, working on Valmo - Meesho’s in-house logistics network.
Previously, I was a Data Scientist at Microsoft in Bangalore, where I focused on Audience Targeting for Microsoft Advertising.

Before that, I spent four years at IIT Kanpur - learning a lot, getting confused even more, and somehow making it through.

I was born in Bikaner and raised in Delhi - two contrasting places that, in their own ways, shaped who I am. 

I love to brew coffee, cook and go for long runs.

This website is my digital garden - a space to explore and share ideas as they take shape.
