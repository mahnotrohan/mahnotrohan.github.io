Hi, I’m Rohan. I’m a Product Manager at Meesho, working in Fulfillment & Experience.

Previously, I was a Data Scientist at Microsoft, where I worked on audience targeting for Microsoft Advertising. 

Before that, I studied at IIT Kanpur. I was born in Bikaner and raised in Delhi.

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, brewing coffee, reading memoirs, and going for long runs - I’ve been running regularly for the last five years.

This website is my digital garden: a place where I share ideas as I make meaning out of life, and thoughts as they slowly take shape.
