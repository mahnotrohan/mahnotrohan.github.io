title: Brewing a new bag of coffee
---

## Goal

Choose your target:

- Black or milk-based
- Filter or espresso-style
- Extract the tasting notes

## Core Variables (Most to Least Impact)

1. **Coffee**: Fresh roasted specialty coffee
2. **Grind Size**: Coarse (French Press) → Medium (Pour Over) → Fine (Aerpress / Espresso Style)
3. **Water Temp**: 90-96°C. Lower for dark roasts, higher for light
4. **Ratio**: Start with 1:16 coffee:water
5. **Time**
6. **Agitation**: Minimal for clarity, more for body

## Quick Recipes

### French Press

- 15g coffee : 250g water
- Coarse grind

### Aeropress (Inverted)

- 12g coffee : 200g water
- Medium-fine grind

### V60

- 1:15 ratio
- Medium grind
- 5 equal pours

## Troubleshooting

Sour? (Under-extracted)

- Grind finer
- Hotter water
- Higher steep time
- More agitation

Bitter? (Over-extracted)

- Do opposite

Change one variable at a time to arrive at the best recipe
