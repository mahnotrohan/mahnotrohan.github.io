title: Thoughts On Forever
---

Lately, I’ve been thinking about forever - not in some big, dramatic way, just noticing how things come and go, like clouds drifting across the sky.

It’s funny how we latch onto moments. A warm piece of cake on a rainy evening. A friend’s laughter filling your room at 3 AM. That first date where you stayed up till sunrise, both pretending you weren’t exhausted. Small things, really. But we hold onto them, hoping they’ll last. I guess that’s just how we’re wired.

But everything moves at its own pace. Your favourite restaurant closes. The friend who knew all your secrets moves halfway across the world. The job that once felt like a dream slowly stops fitting right.

I used to think that was devastating, but now I’m not so sure. Maybe it’s more like finishing a really good book - there’s that ache when you turn the last page, but you’re different for having read it. People, places, moments—they all leave something behind, like footprints in fresh snow.

Some things, yeah, you hold onto. If someone spends most of their life with a partner and loses them, expecting them to just move on feels wrong. Some attachments stay, even when you can’t walk those same paths anymore.

But often, letting go is its own kind of grace. Not the dramatic kind you see in movies, but something quieter. Like how you sometimes wake up and realize you haven't thought about something that once consumed you for weeks. The world keeps spinning, and somehow you find yourself walking forward without having planned it.

Everything has its time, it's ending - and that’s what makes it beautiful. Those moments where everything just clicks, where you feel completely at peace - they don’t stay. But maybe they don’t need to.
