title: Predicament With Restaurant Recommendation
date: 2025-02-26

Everyone loves a good meal and every few days, someone visits a new restaurant. Maybe it’s trending on Instagram, maybe there’s a discount on Swiggy/Zomato, maybe it just won an award. Or a friend recommended it.

People love recommending food and restaurants. Maybe it’s about sharing joy, maybe it’s about signaling taste or maybe its about finding like minded people, who knows? But it is a battleground of strongly held opinions.

The problem with restaurant recommendations is twofold. First, different people look for different things - some care about the food, some about the vibe, some just want a place that won’t mess up their order. Second, taste in food is personal. A dish that feels soul soothing to one person might be just okay to someone else.

But for all the risks, recommendations also lead to some of the best dining experiences. They help you find hidden gems, try food you wouldn’t have otherwise, and sometimes even give you a new go-to spot.

So when someone asks for a rec, the key is figuring out what they are looking for. Most people are happy with a place that serves decent food and has a nice atmosphere. And of course - don’t suggest a ramen bar when they’re asking for Chinese.
