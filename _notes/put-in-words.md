On putting things in words

I’ve been more active online lately, posting more pictures and writing more on Instagram and my personal website. I’ve noticed it myself and I’m aware of how it can look.

What’s actually happening is this. I’m choosing what parts of my life I let exist outside my head.

I write because talking helps me think. If I don’t put things into words, they stay unexamined. Silence doesn’t resolve them. It just leaves them unstructured.

Over time, I’ve realized this is close to what Viktor Frankl meant by meaning. If you can make sense of something, you can survive it. This writing isn’t about performance. It’s about understanding things as they happen.

I think we owe ourselves that honesty. The space to look at our own lives without pretending. I remember reading something by C. S. Lewis years ago. I don’t recall the exact words, but the idea stayed with me. You can’t really succeed if you lie to yourself.

So I keep writing. Publicly. Imperfectly. Because naming things feels more honest to me than leaving them unnamed.
