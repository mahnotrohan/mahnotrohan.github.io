I complete a year at Meesho on 16th Feb. And I hope this is the first one of many. 

It has been nothing short of character defining arc. 

Few things about the culture I really really admire:

- Pre-reads. No fancy decks, no hiding behind data. You send a pre-read. If leaders have read it, they’ll ask questions. Come prepared
- Problem first mindset. It can be irritating sometimes because ask a lot of questions, but this cultural aspect has led Meesho to challenge so many mental models and build new ones.
- Thinking in systems. Specially in FnE, at this scale, patch works creates a scaffolding, which eventually breaks.
- People are incredibly smart.
- Talking to your users. Everyone from a Designer to HR follow this. And it operates on a power law here. You either find exceptional listeners or complete word-vomiters.

Things I’m not a fan of, but learning to accept:

- Information (read: gossip) travels alarmingly fast. Chinese whispers get creative
- You can be thrown under the bus, be prepared.
- Narratives change easily, sometimes just because people can, they will change it.
- People’s moods can determine what you work on.
- The Dunning–Kruger effect is real. If you don’t guard your slice, someone *will* eat it

The best part of this place, though, is the people, the mission, and the leaders.
