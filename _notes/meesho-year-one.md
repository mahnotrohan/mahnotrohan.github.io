I complete a year at Meesho on 16th Feb. And I hope this is the first one of many. 

It has been nothing short of character defining arc. 

Few things about the culture I really really admire:

- Pre-reads. No fancy decks, no hiding behind data. You send a pre-read. If leaders have read it, they’ll ask questions. Come prepared
- Problem first mindset. Its a pain in the ass, but incredible
- Thinking in systems. Scaffoldings of patch work, eventually falls, and hits hard.
- People are smart. And not in pretentious  I-have-a-degree-I-am-smart.
- “Listen or Die”. This operates on a power law here. You either find exceptional listeners or complete word-vomiters

Things I’m not a fan of, but learning to accept:

- Information (read: gossip) travels alarmingly fast. Chinese whispers get creative
- You can be thrown under the bus, be prepared.
- Narratives change easily — sometimes just because people
- People’s moods can determine what you work on (hopefully over a week, possibly over a quarter)
- The Dunning–Kruger effect is real. If you don’t guard your slice, someone *will* eat it

The best part of this place, though, is the people, the mission, and the leaders.

Regardless of when this innings ends, I’ll remain honest, unapologetic, and daring with my time here, as I continue to work on my craft
