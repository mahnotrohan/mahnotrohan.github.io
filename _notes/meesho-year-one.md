I complete a year at Meesho on 16th Feb. And I hope this is the first one of many. 

It has been nothing short of character defining arc. 

Few things about the culture I really really admire:

- Pre-reads. You don't attend a meeting without thinking/coming prepared.
- Problem first mindset. Somedays, it can be a pain in the ass, but the right thing to do.
- Thinking in systems. Scaffoldings of patch work, eventually falls, and hits hard.
- People are smart. And not in pretentious  I-have-a-degree-I-am-smart.
- “Listen or Die”. This operates on a power law here. You either find great listeners or complete word-vomiters.

Things I’m not a fan of, but learning to accept:

- Information (read: gossip) travels here alarmingly fast. Chinese whispers get creative.
- You can be thrown under the bus, be prepared.
- Narratives change easily - sometimes just because people can.
- People’s moods can determine what you work on.
- The Dunning–Kruger effect is real. If you don’t guard your slice, someone *will* eat it.

The best part of this place, though, is the people, the mission, and the leaders.

Regardless of when this innings ends, I want to be daring with my time here, and build my craft.
